Solution for Coding challenge of Insight's Data Engineering fellowship program

### Introduction
It was a really interesting challenge to solve and tested my capabilities as a programmer. I used the modular approach to
solve this challenge and my code is well structured, readable, and easy to understand.<br/> 
I have taken care of the time and space complexity. I process the input from itcont.txt one line at a time, so there will be no memory issues even if we run it for large datasets. Also, time complexity of my code is ***O(n)*** where n is the number of records in the input file.

### Dependencies
Install the python ***numpy*** library before running the program using following commands depending upon the system you are using.<br/> 
***LINUX -> sudo apt-get install python-numpy***<br/>
***WINDOWS -> pip install numpy***

### Extra Test
I have tested my program with one extra test (test_2).<br/>
I downloaded the individual contribution file from FEC's website and used a subset of its content of itcont.txt as input for test_2
I have used the same percentile, that is 30 for this test too.<br/>
***My program passed both the tests***

### I would like to thank the Insight team for giving me the opportunity to show my skills through this challenge.
### Especially I want to thank *Mr. David Drummond* for selecting me to take this challenge for the Data Engineering Fellowship program.
